    <p>
        There were a lot of steps for our jewlery tree inorder for us to make the tree we take 5 meters
        of wire then we cut them into 21, eleven inch pieces. After we put them through the holes of a colander with
        holes and start twisting the wire, we stop when we have a base after that we take one wire out and we keep
        twisting.
        You do that all the way up until you have enough branches for the tree. Below are picture of our season trees,
        we have one for every season with specific colors.

    <h3>
        <center>This is how we make our earrings</center>
    </h3>

    <p>
        For our errings we take 2 pieces of wire and fold them in half
        and leave a little loop at the top. Then we pick the amount of
        beads that we want and put one through the wire and cross the wire
        and put the next bead. When your done with your beads you twist
        the end and your done!

        <h3>
        <center>This is how we make our rings </center>
        </h3>

        <p>

            For our rings we get a piece of wire (length depends on ring size)
            and then you add the bead and fold it in half after that you measure the wire to the size that you want and
            you have two pieces of wire left.
            With those pieces left you fold them over and start wrapping it and then you are done.
