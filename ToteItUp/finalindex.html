        Our product is handmade, good quality, and useful. You can carry your extra schoolbooks, sports stuff, or anything else that you want to. 
        It could be your new lunch bag or a gift bag. We use good quality fabrics and if you want to see how we make them go to the process page to see. 
        We have a lot of different patterns to choose from, some of them are outdoor fabric, and all of the rest are cotton, some of which are quilting cotton. 
        We double lined the bag so there is a different fabric in the inside versus the outside.
