            <p>Our teams products are many different styles of combs! We have a large variety of comb designs, varying from kittens to frogs! Each comb is small, which makes it accessible, portable, and cute! Our adorable combs are made out of resin, that means our combs are durable and leak-proof. We also have glitter to give our combs an extra sparkle!
            </p>
            <p>Our product is made by multiple consecutive steps. The first step is to combine resin and resin hardener together. Mix and stir the two liquids until they have fully submerged together. Then, add your chose of color, glitter, and scent. Poor the mixture into resin comb molds, and let it sit for 24 hours. Thatâ€™s it!
