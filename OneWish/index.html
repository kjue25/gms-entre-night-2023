            <h2>What Is It, Actually?</h2>
            <p>Our company, One Wish, sells bracelets! But not just any bracelets... Our bracelets are wish bracelets! Why are they called "wish" bracelets, you might ask? When you tie this bracelet around your wrist you make a wish. When the bracelet eventually falls apart or breaks, then your wish might come true! It is a super fun, stylish, cool, cute, bracelet for anyone to wear!</p>

            <h2>How We Came Up With The Idea</h2>
            <p>As a group we have thought long and hard about what to make. We wanted to make something people would buy and something that is not super basic. We had the idea of jewlery and we came up with many ways to make it uniqe. We eventually decided on a wish bracelet. Something that would be different but cute and cool. Something that can have many different styles for every type of person.</p>
