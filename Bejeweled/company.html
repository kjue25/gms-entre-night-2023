<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Hi, we are team Bejeweled! Our team consists of four people: Isabella, Mihika, Kira, and Kate. We all currently attend the Girls Middle School, where we were placed in the same entre group. Although some of us had known others in this group from before, this was going to be a new and exciting experience for all of us. All of us work really well as a group with different skills to add.</p>
