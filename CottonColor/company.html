 <h1 id="margin" >Meet our Team!</h1>
 <p><h3 id="margin" >Our team has 5 members. Erin, Ellie, Mackenzie, Emma, and Victoria! Each person on our team is a VP. 
    There are 5 VP's on our team. The VP of Manufacturing, the VP of Finance, the VP of Sales, the VP of Communications
    and the VP of Marketing. 
 </p>
 <h3 id="margin" >We had the idea of making tie dye items when we decided we wanted a colorful product. After we had our product idea, we took a while to decide on a name
    because we all wanted different types of names. We are happy to say that we came to our current name CottonColor because color relates
    to our colorful tie dyed products with all of them being made out of cotton!</h3>
