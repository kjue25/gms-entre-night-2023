  <h1>Our Products </h1>


<p>
Our homemade products are here to make anyone happy. Our lip gloss will make you look good and feel good. These popsicle lip glosses give an amazing shimmer to your lips 
and make them a royal red. Also, there is a nice watermelon scent on the lip gloss and cute packaging with it too. 
Our turtles are cute, cuddly, nice, and soft. These turtles could be your new companion. 
You can bring them to watch movies! Or give it to your friend as a birthday present! 
Our goal is to make all of our customers happy with our product and our hope is that you will keep them for a long time. 
20% of our profits go to Save The Turtles! Buy one or buy 2! It benefits you, and the turtles! ❤️
